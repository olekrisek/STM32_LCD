The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_l_c_d}{LCD}} library for STM32 Microcontroller provides a convenient way to drive a text-\/based \mbox{\hyperlink{class_l_c_d}{LCD}} display using STM32 microcontrollers. This library is based on the existing C code from the Liquid\+Crystal library, but with additional enhancements and modifications to better suit the STM32 platform.

This library offers a different initialization method that allows the digital lines (data lines) to be on the same port while the control signals can be on different ports. It also provides support for multiple \mbox{\hyperlink{class_l_c_d}{LCD}} displays connected to the same microcontroller.

One notable feature of this library is the modified print override, which ensures that the printed data is directed specifically to the targeted \mbox{\hyperlink{class_l_c_d}{LCD}} display without interfering with other print destinations such as console or UART implementations.\hypertarget{index_usage}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{index_usage}
To use the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_l_c_d}{LCD}} library in your STM32 project, include the appropriate header files and link against the library during the compilation process. Refer to the documentation and examples for detailed instructions on how to integrate and utilize the library\textquotesingle{}s functionality in your code.\hypertarget{index_resources}{}\doxysection{Resources}\label{index_resources}
